Discussion points 3/1/16

1.) Citing powerpoint presentation on cryptic relatedness.  Does not appear to be a publication, but samples were removed as described in the ppt.
2.) Including John Quackenbush on paper?
3.) Use of variable names, s_ij
4.) Sampling procedure... want to avoid LD [Results seemed to be similar whether done via spaced sampling or complete sampling]
5.) Confirm probability of IBD is equivalent to coefficient of kinship.
6.) Deviating from refering to statistic as "Jaccard" or "weighted Jaccard" because although it started out that way it has evolved away from it and using that name may be confusing.
